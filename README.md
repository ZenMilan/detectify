Detectify provides a simple way to retrieve an ActiveRecord entity based on the domain/subdomain request information.

Itâ€™s a Ruby gem, similar to Houser, that helps you retrieve an Active Record entity from a database with a URL. You know Houser is a multi-tenancy gem that can send database requests using subdomain names. But Houser is a relatively old Ruby library. For modern Rails-based SaaS apps, we wanted more flexibility. That's why we've developed Detectify.
For more information, you can read here [Detectify review](https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-we-retrieve-tenant-data-in-a-multi-tenant-app).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

`gem 'detectify', github: 'rubygarage/detectify'`

and then execute: `$ bundle`

Finally, restart the server to apply the changes.

Detectify only supports applications built with Ruby 2.2.2 and Rails 4.2 or higher.

## Usage

Start off by generating an initializer:

`$ bundle exec rails g detectify:install`

this will create file `config/initializers/detectify.rb` in your application directory.

You can configure Detectify for your application needs via initializer. After this you can access detected entity via: `request.env['Detectify-Entity']`.
